          # an mpirun that is not associated with the MPI used to build the
          # CLTs.  Note that Meson failed as expected when I didn't install any
          # MPI implementation, which suggests that there isn't a default
          # installation.  Unfortunately paths to mpirun and mpicxx don't offer
          # much insight into what is found or if there are crossed
          # installations.
          #
          # Next testing steps would be to build a minimal MPI program and see
          # if I can reproduce the issue.
